# Simple ToDo App with PERN Stack
This simple ToDo app uses the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React and Node) stack. The focus was mainly on the backend development, which also included integration and end-to-testing. Addiotnally, the goal was to create a complete CI/CD deployment pipeline which deploy the app on Heroku as final stepp after all lights are green so to say.
